# Project3_GourmetFood
Project 3 for OOAD involving creating a program for a Gourmet Food Chain.

Team Members: Darrien Lee, Gregorio Figueroa, Jackson Meyer

Assumptions: As far as assumptions go there are not any in particular and followed the instructions provided.

Language: We used Java as the main language of the program, and did most of our work in IntelliJ as our environment IDE.

Program Design: The program used the factory design pattern for the rolls and for the decorators, as well as the decorator pattern for any add-ons for each roll. We also have an observer that announces certain aspects of the program, mostly daily information.
