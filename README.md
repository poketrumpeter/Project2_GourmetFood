# Project3_GourmetFood
Project 3 for OOAD involving creating a program for a Gourmet Food Chain.

Team Members: Darrien Lee, Gregorio Figueroa, Jackson Meyer

Assumptions: As far as assumptions go there are not any in particular and followed the instructions provided.

Language: We used Java 14 as the main language of the program, and did most of our work in IntelliJ as our environment IDE.

Program Design: The program used the factory design pattern for the rolls and for the decorators, as well as the decorator pattern for any add-ons for each roll. We also have an observer that announces certain aspects of the program, mostly daily information.

Issues: Some of us were not able to get the JUnit testing modules working correctly on our machine, and therefore our output file does not reflect the tests and can be run on certain machines with the correct jar dependencies.
